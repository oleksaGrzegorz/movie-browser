# 🎬 Movies Browser  

A modern web application for browsing movies and TV shows. Built with **React** and bundled with **Vite** for lightning-fast development. State management is powered by **Redux Toolkit**, navigation is handled with **React Router**, and styling is implemented with **styled-components**.  

We followed the **Scrum methodology** during development, organizing our work into sprints and tracking progress in **Trello**. The user interface was created based on a **Figma design project**, ensuring a consistent and visually appealing look.
